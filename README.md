# MELODY BUZZER PROJECT 

Melody Buzzer Project â€“ Where Sound Meets Creativity! ðŸŽ¶ðŸ””

Excited to share my latest project: Melody Buzzer! This simple yet engaging project turns an ordinary buzzer into a musical instrument, playing different tones and melodies using code.

ðŸ”¹ What it does: Generates musical notes using a buzzer and a microcontroller (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.).
ðŸ”¹ How it works: By programming frequency variations, it produces recognizable tunes.
ðŸ”¹ Why itâ€™s cool: Great for learning about sound waves, electronics, and programming in a fun way!

This project is perfect for STEM enthusiasts, hobbyists, and educators looking to introduce coding through sound
